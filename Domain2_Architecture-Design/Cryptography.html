    <h2 align="center">Cryptographic Concepts</h2>
      <p>A cryptographic algorithm is a set of mathematical functions which uses a (often secret) string of data
        known as a key, to encrypt/decrypt other data.
      </p>
      <ul>Two main types of encryption algorithms
        <li>Symmetric Encryption</li>
        <li>Asymmetric Encryption</li><br>
        <li>Hashing algorithms are computed one way - meaning the output cannot be returned to the original
          plaintext.
        </li>
      </ul>

  <ul>Data States:
    <li>In-Transit: any data sent across the network</li>
    <li>At-Rest: Any data currently located in memory, including databases and backups</li>
    <li>In-Use: Any data actively used by a process</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>API Considerations</h3>
    <ul>Two Types of Web API Security
      <li>{{REST}}: uses http and TLS encryption standards</li>
      <li>{{SOAP}}: use built in protocols known as Web Services Security (WS Security)</li>
