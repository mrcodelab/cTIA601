          <p>{{Data Sovereignty}}: <br>
            Regulatory compliance applies to both active and backup data. Know the laws for your storage site.

          <ul>Data Protection
            <li>Data Availability</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Make sure data is protected and available under all circumstances</li>
              <li>Ensures users have the data they need to contduct business</li>

            <li>Data Management</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Data lifecycle management is the automated process of moving critical data to online and offline storage</li>
              <li>Information lifecycle management is a comprehensive strategy for valuing, cataloging, and protecting information assets from
                application and user errors, attacks, or hardware and facility failures.

        <ul>
          <li>Operationally between a hot and cold site</li>
          <li>May have hardware and software in a <<span class="emphasized">stopped</span> state, requiring only starting up and a differential backup restore</li>
          <li>Less expensive than a hot site, but more costly than cold as the system is in near ready condition</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cold Sites</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A backed up facility that has the necessary infrastructure, but not the actual computer equipment in place</li>
          <li>A cold site is not ready for immediate operations and typically takes a few days to bring online</li>
