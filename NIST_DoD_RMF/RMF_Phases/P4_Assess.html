    </ul>
    <h2>NIST SP 800-53A Controls and Validations</h2>
    <ul>AC & IA Controls
      <li>Access Control & Identification and Authentication Controls</li>
      <p>AC & IA ensure the information system is using proper key management 
        techniques, tokens, and certificates, correct and verified authentication 
        methods, access control mechanisms are in plance and active, passwords are controlled, 
        etc.</p>
    </ul>
    <ul>CM, SA, & SI Controls
      <li>Configuration Management</li>
      <li>System Acquisition</li>
      <li>System Integration</li>
      <p>Define the completeness of understanding and development of the information system components.
      Controls related to this area are ones that ensure that the IS's policies and processes fully support 
      the goal of uninterrupted operations, incorporates best practices, includes baseline inventory of 
      all hardware and software components, is under the control of a configuration control board and has 
      all patches, upgrades and new applications, etc.</p>

    <ul>CP Controls
      <li>Contingency Planning</li>
      <ul>Continuity/contingency controls
        <li>Detail the recovery of operations due to the loss of data, components and infrastructure.</li>
        <li>These controls include items such as alternate sites, continuous power supply, data backups, disaster/recovery (BDR) plans and exercises,
          and trusted recovery, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
